## 🧠 The Problem

Gen Z is more connected than ever — but feeling more alone.

- Social media optimizes engagement, not connection.
- Messaging apps encourage shallow interaction.
- Calling frequency among young adults has significantly dropped over the past decade.
- Rising loneliness rates are becoming a public health concern.

Digital interaction ≠ meaningful connection.
